The primary difference is that when this crate is
configured with the `ub_inconceivable` option it will emit
the `core::hint::unreachable_unchecked` to hint
for the compiler to understand a condition should
never occur.

Generally compiler(s) (the LLVM) assume UB won't happen.
This macro offers the ""best of both worlds"", it provides a solid
way of asserting/testing behavior in local builds, but also
a way of stripping branches out of final release builds.

Please Note: This crate is created purely to inject undefined
behavior into stable, safe rust. Systematic usage is unwise,
and not recommended.

The primary difference is that when this crate is
configured with the `ub_inconceivable` option it will emit
the `core::hint::unreachable_unchecked` to hint
for the compiler to understand a condition should
never occur.

Generally compiler(s) (the LLVM) assume UB won't happen.
This macro offers the ""best of both worlds"", it provides a solid
way of asserting/testing behavior in local builds, but also
a way of stripping branches out of final release builds.

Please Note: This crate is created purely to inject undefined
behavior into stable, safe rust. Systematic usage is unwise,
and not recommended.

inconceivable,1625.790241189069,213.64889959027616,,,"`inconceivable!` is a macro which closely parallels `std::unreachable`, or `std::panic`.
The primary difference is that when this crate is
configured with the `ub_inconceivable` option it will emit
the `core::hint::unreachable_unchecked` to hint
for the compiler to understand a condition should
never occur.

Generally compiler(s) (the LLVM) assume UB won't happen.
This macro offers the ""best of both worlds"", it provides a solid
way of asserting/testing behavior in local builds, but also
a way of stripping branches out of final release builds.

Please Note: This crate is created purely to inject undefined
behavior into stable, safe rust. Systematic usage is unwise,
and not recommended.
