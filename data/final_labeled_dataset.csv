The primary difference is that when this crate is
configured with the `ub_inconceivable` option it will emit
the `core::hint::unreachable_unchecked` to hint
for the compiler to understand a condition should
never occur.

Generally compiler(s) (the LLVM) assume UB won't happen.
This macro offers the ""best of both worlds"", it provides a solid
way of asserting/testing behavior in local builds, but also
a way of stripping branches out of final release builds.

Please Note: This crate is created purely to inject undefined
behavior into stable, safe rust. Systematic usage is unwise,
and not recommended.
